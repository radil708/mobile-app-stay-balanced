Have you ever wanted to keep track of how well your doing when your doing 
isometric excercises like wall squats or six inches? 

Look no further than "Stay Balanced"

With stay balanced you can keep track of your performance for isometric excercises!
  - It provides live audio feedback during the excercise and warns you if you are getting out of form
  - It will also give you audio feedback when the timer is almost up
  - Keep track of your progress as you go!
    > Stay balanced will automatically track your progress and display it in the history tab!

Notice:
  App requires a phone with gryroscope and rotation sensor to operate
